#   FAIL  → a lib dir is missing provenance or was built from an older submodule
#           commit; rebuild + restamp before merging.

Bundled libkrun is out of sync with the pinned submodule. Rebuild and restamp:
  macOS:  cargo make build-libkrun                 # stamps lib/
  Linux:  ./scripts/build-libkrun-linux.sh         # stamps lib/linux-<arch>/
then commit the updated lib/ (binaries + libkrun.provenance). This is the guard
that prevents shipping a stale libkrun (e.g. missing TSI egress enforcement).
